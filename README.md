🔵 Grounded DI² OS — Deterministic Intelligence Stack (∆H = 0.0041–0.0049)

Scroll-Governed | Audit-Stable | Entropy-Locked

Grounded DI OS is a sealed deterministic runtime for auditable reasoning, compliance-grade decision output, and logic-bound artifact reproduction. Unlike probabilistic models, Grounded DI enforces logic seals through scroll-layer constraints, entropy floors, and irreversible state lineage.

“Every step is auditable. Every step is deterministic.”

🧠 Core Features

Module	Function
🧩 Scroll Compliance Engine	Executes logic under DI Principles 0–160 with clause-locked traceability
🛡️ Deterministic Audit Fabric (DAF)	Tamper-proof output sealing, replayable capsules, and proof-of-origin
🛰️ Mesh Guard Orchestrator (MGO)	Controls node admission, rule compliance, and network quarantine
🧮 MathWise DI2	Certainty Scoring without probability — triggers HALT on contradiction
🧬 Entropy-Aware Runtime	∆H = 0.0041–0.0049 sets expression variance, tone class, and drift boundaries

📜 Patent Series (#32–#36) – Deterministic Audit Stack

Filing No.	Name	Function	Regulatory Map
#32	Seam & Anchor Protocol	Authorship & lineage logging	EU AI Act Art. 12–13
#33	DI² Convergence Supervisor	Drift monitoring & causal replay	Art. 9 (risk mgmt), NIST RMF
#34	ELOC Enforcement	Gatekeeping + override integrity	Art. 14–15
#35	Mesh Guard Orchestrator (MGO)	Network control + node quarantine	Art. 15, NIST GOVERN
#36	Deterministic Audit Fabric (DAF)	Replayable case sealing + traceable outputs	Art. 12, Art. 17 (QMS)

✅ Filing #36 locks the stack before full EU AI Act enforcement (Aug 2026), giving first-mover compliance advantage.

⚖️ Example: Entropy-Sealed Output Divergence

Entropy	Outcome
∆H = 0.0049	Creative scope permitted (e.g. metaphor, structured speculation)
∆H = 0.0041	Fail-closed deterministic mode — blocks speculative or unverifiable content

“Deterministic precision lives in the last centimeter.”
Scroll logic denies outputs with mutation drift, emotion manipulation, or unverifiable gene therapy claims under sealed protocols.
